        <h1>Our Chapter</h1>
        <p>RIT InterVarsity is a group that strives to bring Jesus to the
          students of RIT. We are a group of diverse students who are
          welcoming, inviting, driven, and eager to meet new people.
          We exist to see students and faculty transformed, campuses
          renewed, and world changers developed. We strive to address
          current, relative issues in the lives of RIT students, in
          particular the isolation that is so often felt on campus, and
          the incredible importance that we place on academic success
          and job placement as an assurance of future security.	Our goal,
          in response to God's love, grace, and truth, is to be and
          advance a witnessing community of students and faculty at RIT
          who follow Jesus as Savior and Lord. We desire to grow in love
          for God, God's Word, God's people of every ethnicity and culture,
          and God's purposes in the world.</p>
        <h1>Meet our Servant Team</h1>
        <p>Servant team is a group of InterVarsity's members who are
          committed to the vision of InterVarsity and who work towards
          bringing that vision to life on campus. Servant team is made
          up of multiple members who use their particular skills to help
          lead the necessary functions in InterVarsity such as large group
          coordinating, small groups leadering, outreach planning, resource
          management, and so on. Though the team is still a group of flawed
          people who are not perfect, they are committed to seeing God's
          will be brought to campus, helping the campus experience Jesus,
          and helping InterVarsity to grow.</p>
        <h2>Doug Smith - President</h2>
        <p>I am the President of InterVarsity at RIT, and I am studying
          Industrial Engineering. In the past, I have been Vice President
          as well as a Freshman Small Group leader. I love Jesus, and grew
          up as a pastor's kid in Williamson New York. I have been through
          the ups and (mostly) downs of the Buffalo Bills. I love watching
          The Office, and I like to run, but I need a little motivation once
          in awhile.</p>
        <h2>Sean Bayley - Vice President</h2>
        <p>Hello, my name is Sean Bayley. I am an Electrical Engineering
          major at RIT. I''m from Perkasie, PA. I am one of the co-vice
          presidents who leads the strategy team with Daniel Schwab. We
          help to plan our new student events and help to lead our outreach
          on campus. In my life I have seen God teach me a lot about what it
          means to love people. I hope that He continues to grow me and
          InterVarsity in His mission of love as well. Other than serving
          in InterVarsity I like watching movies (Star Wars is my favorite),
          playing guitar and piano, and spending time with friends. If you
          ever have any questions about what we do in InterVarsity or what
          we do to outreach on campus, feel free to contact me!</p>
        <h2>Daniel Schwab - Vice President</h2>
        <p>I am an Industrial Design major and I will soon be picking up web
          design and music minors because it sounded fun and fit my schedule.
          In InterVarsity I work alongside Sean Bayley as co vice president,
          which means I get to find and explore service, outreach, and
          evangelism opportunities for IV on campus. If that sounds
          complicated, think of me as someone who can never have enough
          friends. I grew up in a Christian family, and have loved the
          truth and authority of God in the Bible for as long as I can
          remember. I often fail to serve God, but I am thankful for any
          capacity which he can use me for His glory.</p>
        <h2>Jessie Schnall - Small Group Coordinator</h2>
        <p>Hey! I'm Jessie and I'm the Small Group Coordinator for
          InterVarsity Christian Fellowship at RIT. In my position, I get
          the opportunity to work with other student leaders to brainstorm &
          create environments for students to grow in their faith, leadership
          skills and relationships at RIT by exploring and responding to
          God's word together. If you have any questions about joining a
          small group or becoming a small group leader, don't hesitate to
          contact me and we can chat over some coffee, my treat! </p>
        <h2>Alex Eckard - Large Group Coordinator</h2>
        <p>Hi! I am Alex Eckard the Large Group Coordinator at RIT IVCF. I
          am from a small town called Jersey Shore, right in the middle of...
          Pennsylvania? Anyway, I am blessed to be able to plan the fun and
          transforming large group events we host each and every Friday
          night. God found me a few years ago in high school and since then
          He has been challenging me to grow closer in His word and His way,
          blessing me with opportunities to teach high school youth at my
          church, lead worship, and coordinate large group with a wonderful
          team of individuals. If you're interested in learning more about
          large group, or just want to know more about me, feel free to
          contact me!</p>
        <h2>Jeremy Willman - Resource Coodinator</h2>
        <p>I grew up in the small town of Middletown, MD before coming to
          RIT, where I'm now a 5th year mechanical engineer at RIT,
          graduating in May 2016. I come from a large family, having four
          younger sisters, as well as five dogs, cats, turtles, ferrets
          and all sorts of other pets. In my free time, I enjoy numerous
          outdoor activities such as skiing, rock climbing, hiking and
          kayaking. I also have been playing ice hockey since the age of
          3 and continue to do so at RIT.</p>
        <h2>Tammy Bixler - IVCF Staff Worker</h2>
        <p>I'm Tammy Bixler, the InterVarsity Campus Staff Member at RIT.
          I was born and raised in Queens, NY, and graduated from
          Binghamton University in 2011 before joining InterVarsity staff,
          getting married, and then moving to Rochester to serve at RIT.
          Since InterVarsity exists on campus to establish and advance
          witnessing communities, I love that it's my job to walk alongside
          and encourage students to grow in their relationship with Jesus
          and their relationship with others.  I provide leadership,
          coaching, and resources to empower students to develop their
          leadership potential and to serve RIT's campus and student body.
          My hope is that as students are transformed by the living, active
          God who loves them, they'll embody his character and live out His
          purposes by loving and stewarding what they've been given not just
          while they are part of the RIT community, but in whatever
          community they find themselves a part of after they graduate.</p>
